# To-Do List
1. Create a form that has 5 inputs: [Employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, and annual salary]

2. Inside of the form, add a submit button that WHEN PRESSED: 
- Adds an employee row
- Updates the footer's total monthly cost
- Clears out inputs after submitting

3. IF the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000:
- Apply over budget class to the footer element in CSS
- Signal that the cost has exceeded the budget. (This can be simply done by adding red to the background or text)

4. Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM.
- The total monthly cost does not need to be updated when employee is deleted. 


Requirements:
- This application should have a form with five inputs that collect a new employee's first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.
When the "Submit" button is clicked:
- A new employee row should be added to the table.
- The footer's total monthly cost should be updated.
- The form inputs should be cleared out.
If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, apply an over-budget CSS class to the footer element.
- When applied, this CSS class should provide a clear visual indication that the monthly cost has been exceeded. (This could be as simple as turning the footer text red.)
Create a "Delete" button that removes an employee from the DOM.
- For base mode, the total monthly cost does not need to be updated when an employee is deleted.
